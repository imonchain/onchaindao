        <h2>About OnChain Capital</h2>
        <p>OnChain Capital is an investment pool focused on growth opportunities within the on-chain ecosystem of multiple blockchains. This is essentially a DAO that pools funds and invests together. We collaborate on investment research and take positions in crypto assets we believe in.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>The fund is managed by OnChain Education and a group of sharp on-chain veterans who work together to grow the investment pool. Anyone is allowed to join the pool, and currently there is only one investment tier for the flagship fund. New investors are welcome to join every 2 weeks, so follow us on X or join the Discord community for new member updates. There will be a Youtube Series covering the growth of OnChain Capital. OnChain Capital does not provide financial advice or a guarentee of profits of any kind.</p>
        <h2>Is there a DAO Token?</h2>
        <p>No there is not, and there are no plans on launching a token. Assume any token claiming to be affiliated with the DAO is a scam. Also, the fund is private and closed, so do not get tricked by impersonators.</p>
        <h2>How are decisions made?</h2>
        <p>Investment ideas can be proposed by anyone in the DAO and feedback is welcomed, but the final decision to buy or sell is granted by OnChainEDU. At the end of the day, this is an experiment, and not a guarentee of future profits. Do not join the fund if you are not fully aware that there is a 2 week notice on withdrawals.</p>
