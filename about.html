        <h2>About OnChainDAO.Club</h2>
        <p>OnChainDAO is an investment pool focused on growth opportunities within the on-chain ecosystem of multiple blockchains. This is a DAO that invests together, and collaborates on investment research.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>The fund is managed by OnChain Education and a group of sharp on-chain veterans who work together to grow the pool. Anyone is allowed to join the pool, and currently there is only one investment tier for the flagship fund. New investors are welcome to join every 2 weeks.</p>
        <h2>How are decisions made?</h2>
        <p>Investment ideas can be proposed by anyone in the DAO and feedback is welcomed, but the final decision to buy or sell is granted by OnChainEDU. At the end of the day, this is an experiment.</p>
