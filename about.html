        <h2>About OnChain Capital</h2>
        <p>OnChain Capital is an experiment. We operate a private "fund" focused on growing a "pool" of "assets". The "assets" we invest in are typically memecoins, and various utility projects on Solana. We trade the riskiest and most volatile markets in the world.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>The fund is managed by OnChain Education and a group of sharp on-chain veterans who work together to grow the asset pool. Follow us on X or join the Discord community for new member updates. DO NOT GET SCAMMED, THE FUND IS CLOSED. OnChain Capital does not provide financial advice or a guarantee of profits of any kind.</p>
        <h2>Is there a DAO Token?</h2>
        <div class="alert">⚠️ No DAO Token exists, and the fund is CLOSED. Beware of scams claiming affiliation!</div>
        <p>No there is not, and there are no plans on launching a token. Assume any token claiming to be affiliated with the DAO is a scam. Also, the fund is private and closed, so do not get tricked by impersonators.</p>
